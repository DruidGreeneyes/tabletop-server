# tabletop-server - currently incomplete
Unnamed client-server application to run networked tabletop/turn-based games

##Goals

* Handle arbitrary gametypes/rulesets
* Be system/memory-light
* Handle multiple unrelated games from multiple unrelated client-groups from a single server instance
* Be easy to configure, set-up, manage
* Learn how all this crap works
